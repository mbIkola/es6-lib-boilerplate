== Boilerplate for node lib. 

Just an empty repo with some pre-installed packages 

What inside:
 - a bit of chai+mocha+sinon+istanbul
 - es6, coverage, lint, compile, watch, tdd, bdd, other bullshit

You ain't need it, i'd recommend to use yeoman generators instead, this project and my desires are .. unconventional
